modalmapsearch
==============

``modalmapsearch`` is a simple javascript tool which opens a modal dialog box
containing a Google Local search.  A callback gets called with the search
result when the user selects one.  It is written using ``jquery`` and
``jquery-ui``.  The only jquery-ui function used is the modal dialog, and with
minimal modifications it could be swapped out for another modal dialog
mechanism.
